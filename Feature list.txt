Drawing:
*Draw reactors up to 24x24x24.
    LMB places the block highlighted in the palette.
    RMB places Air (clears the block).
    MMB places a fuel cell.
*The above works with holding the button down and dragging over the grid.
*Coolers gain a red border if placement conditions aren't met.
*Precise errors are shown for such coolers in the block's tooltips.
*Layout can be toggled between showing one layer at a time or all layers side-by-side.
*Scale can be adjusted using the box in the top right.
*You can clear, copy and paste layers! Keep in mind you can press the mouse button down on the menu, keep it held when highlighting the option, release when over the option and it will act as if clicked.
*You can delete and insert empty layers, expanding or contracting your reactor height as needed!

Saving and export:
*Reactors can be saved/loaded to/from .json.
*Reactors can be exported as an image containing the full reactor layout and stats, this uses the scale set in the scale box.

Simulation:
*For a given layout the planner simulates it as per the mod's reactor code.
*A stats output is generated containing:
    Total number of interior blocks per type.
    Total number of casings needed to cover the outer layer.
    Total cooling generated per tick per cooler type.
    Total cooling, heat, heat difference generated per tick.
    Meltdown time.
    Total energy generated per tick.
    Effective energy generated per tick.
    Total energy generated per fuel pellet.
    Efficiency, heat multiplier.
*All blocks have tooltips that show extensive info about them.

Configuration:
*Cooler and fuel values are configurable.
*General fission reactor values are configurable.
*You can import the settings directly from your nuclearcraft.cfg: "Open configuration" -> Import -> navigate to your minecraft instance and select the nuclearcraft.cfg file.
*You can save/load your configuration settings to a separate file if you want to have (possibly multiple) non-default value sets. Check out the config menu.
*If there is no DefaultConfig.json file in the app's directory, one will be generated with latest vanilla values. This configuration is loaded on application start, overwrite it to have your custom values persist between sessions\versions.

Misc:
*There are tooltips for most ui elements and blocks.
*The planner has automatic updating, you'll see the "1.*.* Available" instead of the usual "Check for Updates" on the update button.
